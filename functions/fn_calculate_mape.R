## this function calculates mean absolute percentage errorm, a simple metric to assess accuracy of a set of projections against real values

calculate_mape <- function(real_series, projected_series) {
  abs_differences <- abs(real_series - projected_series) # calculating the absolute difference between the real and projected series

  percentage_differences <- 100 * (abs_differences / real_series) # expressing the differences as a percentage

  mape <- mean(percentage_differences) # getting the mean of these percentages

  mape <- round(mape, 3)

  return(mape)
