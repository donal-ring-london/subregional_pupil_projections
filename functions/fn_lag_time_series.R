## Function that lags a time series
## again, the years must be in order
## very simple function - takes a time series, creates a new time series from that but with the time period (years) lagged by x number of years

lag_time_series <- function(ts_to_lag,
                            years_to_lag) {
  lagged_ts <- ts(
    data = ts_to_lag,
    start = time(ts_to_lag)[1] + years_to_lag,
    frequency = 1
  )

  return(lagged_ts)
}
