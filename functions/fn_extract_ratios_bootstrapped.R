## this is a specific function, designed to solely to work with an intermediate dataset in this project.
## this intermediate dataset is the projected carryover ratios from one nc year to the next year. We need to extract the right series of these ratios to project a cohort through the nc years.
## for example, if we have the number of nc year 1 pupils in 2021, we need the projected carryover ratio from 2021 to 2022 of year 1 to year 2, then the projected carryover ratio from 2022 to 2023 for year 2 to year 3, the 2023 to 2024 ratio for year 3 to year 4, etc
## this function is designed to extract those ratios.
## but even further, this function extracts the ratios when the input is a dataset with multiple (usually 1,000) bootstrapped versions of the ratio.
## very specific function, assumes particular column names and structure of inputs. For now I can't really see a way around it. But would be good to fix this for later.

  ### getting the sequence of nc years that we need to project for
  nc_year_vec <- c(
    "year_group_1", "year_group_2", "year_group_3", "year_group_4", "year_group_5", "year_group_6", "year_group_7",

  nc_year_seq <- nc_year_vec[nc_year_inds]

  ### getting the sequence of calendar years that we need to project for
  year_seq <- (start_cohort_year + 1):(start_cohort_year + length(nc_year_seq))

  ### getting rid of any years included in the sequence above that go beyond the maximum year in the dataset
  year_seq <- year_seq[year_seq <= max_year]

  nc_year_seq <- nc_year_seq[1:length(year_seq)]

  ### creating column names for the data.table
  colnames_dt <- paste(nc_year_seq, year_seq, sep = "_")

  ### extracting the bootstrapped ratios for the calendar year:nc year combinations (a bit crude and ugly but works fine)
  bootstrapped_tracking_ratios <- data.table() # defining an empty data.table. Ratios will be added as columns to this data.table

  ### looping through each of the nc years and extracting the corresponding ratio
  for (z in 1:length(nc_year_seq)) {
    nc_year_sel <- nc_year_seq[z] # narrowing down to an nc year
    year_sel <- year_seq[z] # narrowing down to the corresponding calendar year

    nc_year_proj <- ratio_dataset_bootstrapped[[nc_year_sel]][[geog]] # this line is very specific to the input dataset. Indexes in such as way as to extract the correct nc year ratio projections for the correct geography in question

    ind <- grep(year_sel, colnames(nc_year_proj)) # this line, along with the line below it, extracts the ratios for the correct calendar year of the nc year ratio projections

    col_to_add <- nc_year_proj[, ..ind]

    bootstrapped_tracking_ratios[, new_col := col_to_add] ## adding a new column to the data.table with the ratios
    colnames(bootstrapped_tracking_ratios)[length(colnames(bootstrapped_tracking_ratios))] <- colnames_dt[z] # naming the most recently added column
  }

  ### returning the outputs
  return(bootstrapped_tracking_ratios)
