## function to project forward an input ts object using exponential smoothing
## it is mostly a wrapper function but a useful one that makes the code a lot neater. The function allows you to define most of the parameters of forecasting an object based on exponential smoothing.

project_with_ets <- function(input_ts,
                             model = "MMN",
                             alpha = NULL,
                             beta = NULL,
                             damped = NULL,
                             phi = NULL,
                             periods_ahead) {
  require(forecast)

  ets_model <- ets(y = input_ts, model = model, alpha = alpha, beta = beta, damped = damped, phi = phi) # creating an exponential smoothing model based on an input time series

  forecast_from_ets <- forecast(ets_model, h = periods_ahead, PI = FALSE) # projecting forwards from the model

  return(forecast_from_ets$mean) # returning just the mean value of the model - it comes with various other outputs but all we want is the mean
}
