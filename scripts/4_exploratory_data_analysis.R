### this is a file containing a lot of exploratory data analysis. It is very messy and is not intended to be updated with new data.
### I have kept it here because there some useful plots and notes, but for anyone reading through the repo to get a sense of how the data processing and modelling works, it's not recommended to look through this file.


## 0. libraries and functions

library(data.table)

source("functions/fn_aggregate_over_columns.R")

## 1. reading in datasets

pupils <- fread("data/processed_data/pupil_numbers/itl_pupil_numbers_1112_to_2223.csv")

births <- fread("data/processed_data/births/itl_births_92_to_23.csv")


#### more stuff (to be reorganised later)


## creating the lagged date variable for births. By isolating year out from births and adding 4. (we also need to isolate a 4-digit year out from pupil numbers)

births[, year := (tstrsplit(date, "-", fixed = TRUE)[1])]
births[, year := as.numeric(year)]

births <- births[!(year <= 2006), ] # getting rid of anything before 2006. 2006 is the first year of useful data we might have

births[, year_lag_4 := year + 4]
births[year_lag_4 > 2022 | year_lag_4 < 2011, year_lag_4 := NA] # setting any greater than 2022 or lesser than 2011 as NA - we can't use these, and for the lagged variable we want the years to align exactly with reception years

births[, year_lag_5 := year + 5]
births[year_lag_5 > 2022 | year_lag_5 < 2011, year_lag_5 := NA]


## isolating out year for reception - it's just the first four digits
pupils[, year := as.numeric(substr(time_period, 1, 4))]


## creating various different datasets, with different aggregations and selections, that we'll want to use (might be useful to  do this in a separate file and then save them? Or is there any point - will we be using them for anything else?).
## I will calculate ratios as needed, before the plots. One reason is because ratios aren't foundational to this piece of work and are only worth calculating to illustrate a specific point. Another is that there will be then be too many complicated permutations of possible datasets and matchings for which to calculate ratios. Something has to give, and it will have to be the ratios.

## to check - reception isn't the statutory starting point. Year 1 is. Is it right, then, to be using reception? (in a sense, yes it is, no matter what the answer is, because that is what Boroughs want)



# next large plotting series - seeing how progression through years vary. One of the main questions that I'll need to answer is what the trend of the ratio is over time.
# and I think there should be some particular attention to year 7. Is it good enough to use survival from years reception to 6? Or should there be information from population and births? Hardly births...

# we need lots of little sub time series...for reception in e.g. 2011, we need year 1 in 2012, year 2 in 2013....etc
# easiest to just do this for one at a time, so do a uk wide one and a then london wide one. Probably no need to go down to ITL level for now
# yes, I should get on to the modelling of reception, but I do want to have my own understanding of progression through school before I do that. It won't take too long to explore this.

#### takeaways? (1) large drop from primary to secondary, even when all geographies are taken into account.
#### (2) there is consistently a large increase in headcount from reception to year 1, and then it stabilises at year 1. So yes, it does look like there is a significant number of families who choose to only enter their children into school at the statutorily-required time, not before.
#### (3) serious covid distortions! And these are the last few periods in the time series. So when modelling progression through school, it might be good to weight these recent year less...or at the very least to choose a method that doesn't give more recent periods more weight than older ones.
#### (4) does not look like the ratio of year 1:reception is consistent throughout time or varies randomly. Looks like there is a trend. So we shouldn't apply a consistent ratio over time. Could either model this ratio separately. Or, we could model the relationship from births to year 1 with a 5 year lag, separately? And then even measure progression based on year 5 rather than reception.

#### takeaways from the London ones, in comparison to rest of UK.
#### (1) much, much more pronounced attrition throughout all years, including 6 to 7, in London than compared to UK as a whole.
#### (2) still a notable increase from reception to year 1. But looks more muted (would need more specific analysis to check), partly because the y axis axis is greater to accommodate the larger drops in later years, but also probably because some families will have moved out of London between reception and year 1.
#### (3) more covid distortions, of course, particularly in the early years of school it seems.
#### (4) but even before covid, the trend from reception to year 1 had reversed! It went from more children in year 1 than reception, to fewer children in year 1 than reception. A very, very, very interesting trend.
