## this script creates one of the two datasets for accuracy testing. This is the script that produces projections using the final intended methodology, i.e. using exponential smoothing and creating prediction intervals using bootstrapping.
## There is a more detailed description of the scheme for accuracy testing in the report/methodology document. But we're using a "window approach", where we produce projections based on all possible windows of real data, of varying series length.
## I am effectively using the same script as script 5_a, the one that produces the 10 year final projections for reception. But it is amended so that most of the modelling is done within a for-loop, looping over different input years, so that we end up with lots of projections to go over. 
## it's a bit clunky and not a very elegant or pleasing solution, but it works just fine and produces the projection I want for real vs actual


## A. libraries and functions
library(data.table)
library(forecast)

library(foreach)
library(doParallel)




functions_to_read <- list.files("functions")

lapply(
  paste0("functions/", functions_to_read),

## B. reading in data, any small cleaning tasks, and extracting vector of unique geographies

  ### B.1. reading in combined lagged births and reception, and creating the ratio
births_reception_og <- fread("data/processed_data/combined/births_reception_lag4.csv")

births_reception_og[, ratio := headcount/annual_births_lag4]


  ### B.2. reading in births, creating year variable (shouldn't I do that in the processing script...?), creating lagged year variable narrowing down to desired years, and getting rid of forward slashes in the name 
births_og <- fread("data/processed_data/births/itl_births_92_to_23.csv") # TO DO - file name shouldn't be date specific

births_og[, year := (tstrsplit(date, "-", fixed = TRUE)[1])]
births_og[, year := as.numeric(year)]

births_og[, year_lag_4 := year + 4]

births_og[, gss_name := gsub("/", "&", gss_name, fixed = TRUE)] # need to change name of one itl because it has a slash in it


  ### B.3. extracting vector of unique geographies
all_geogs <- births_og[, unique(gss_code)]


  ### B.4. reading in the range of years for accuracy testing
input_years <- fread("data_resources/accuracy_testing_windows.csv")


## C. looping through the input years, creating projections for each one
